This project is an API developed in NodeJS that is consumed by the project made in ReactJS, which is available in this repository: https://github.com/henrique010/reactjs-clone-dropbox

and by the project made in React Native, which is available in this repository: https://github.com/henrique010/reactnative-clone-dropbox.git

The API makes use of technologies such as Express, Socket.IO, MongoDB, among others.

Remembering that all the code produced was through the 6th edition of the WeekOmnistack, held by Rocketseat. It's a week of immersion in NodeJS, ReactJS and React Native technologies, as well as the ecosystem that surrounds them.
